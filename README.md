## üìå Project Overview

*Helicobacter pylori* is a Gram-negative, spiral bacterium infecting over half the global population. It is linked to conditions like gastritis, ulcers, and gastric cancer. With increasing antibiotic resistance, identifying **novel, safe, and specific drug targets** is a priority.

This study applied a **genome-wide subtractive genomics approach** to analyze the H. pylori proteome, filter out human homologs, assess essentiality, virulence, druggability, and subcellular localization, and identify **14 non-homologous, essential, cytoplasmic proteins** as viable drug targets.

## üéØ Objectives

- Retrieve and curate the complete H. pylori proteome.
- Filter sequences for non-redundancy and functional viability.
- Perform subtractive genomic filtering against:
  - Human proteome
  - Human anti-targets
  - Gut microbiota
- Analyze essentiality, virulence factors, druggability, and localization.
- Identify unique cytoplasmic proteins as **novel drug targets**.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This study successfully applied subtractive genomics to identify **14 novel, cytoplasmic, non-human homologous drug targets** in *H. pylori*. These proteins represent ideal candidates for **narrow-spectrum antibiotics** that minimize toxicity and off-target effects in humans. This research lays the groundwork for **structure-based drug discovery and future wet-lab validation** against multidrug-resistant H. pylori infections.

## üî≠ Future Directions

- Structural modeling and docking of lead inhibitors against identified proteins
- Experimental (wet-lab) validation of cytoplasmic targets
- Exploring these targets in **multi-drug synergy and resistance evasion models**
- Develop **strain-specific antimicrobial therapies** based on these targets
